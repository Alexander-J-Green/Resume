At Optum, I worked on a team of ten developers to maintain and enhance Optum's Specialty Drug app for nurses and pharmacists. I gained hands-on experience with front-end technologies like React and Redux, as well as back-end development using Spring Boot and MySQL. Additionally, I learned to debug and deploy code using Azure Cloud Services and became proficient in using GitHub, gaining valuable insight into the full development lifecycle.
