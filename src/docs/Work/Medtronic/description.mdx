At Medtronic, I led front-end development for the Interoperability app, working in an Agile environment to build reusable 
components and ensure code consistency. Collaborating closely with a partner developer and quality engineer, I helped refine 
the app's interface and functionality while managing key features such as API integration and form generation.
