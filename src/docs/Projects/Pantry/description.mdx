The Cookbook is a recipe tracker that enables users to create and manage accounts, maintain a pantry of ingredients, and build recipes using those pantry items. The application offers a user-friendly interface to store your favorite recipes, track ingredients, and manage calorie counts. This app was developed as my capstone project for York Solutions' Barriers to Entry (B2E) program, completed over two weeks. The goal was to design and implement both the frontend and backend independently, resulting in a fully functional application.
