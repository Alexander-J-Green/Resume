Learning Labyrinth is an interactive Java learning application designed to help junior developers test and improve their Java skills. Users can log in and solve mazes by writing Java code that navigates a robot through the maze. This project is aimed at providing a fun and educational experience for those interested in Java programming. The application was developed by my team of student developers as part of our Introduction to Software Engineering class (CS506) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Our team consisted of five developers, with the other four members focusing on backend development. I was solely responsible for developing the frontend using React and Redux.
