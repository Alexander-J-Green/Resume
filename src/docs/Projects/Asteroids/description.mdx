Asteroids is a space-themed game where players control a spaceship to dodge or shoot falling asteroids. The goal is to survive as long as possible while earning points by destroying asteroids. Power-ups periodically appear, boosting the spaceshipâ€™s firing speed. This game was developed as a self-teaching project to improve my knowledge of React, particularly in state management, handling side effects (useEffect), and setting up intervals for gameplay loops.
